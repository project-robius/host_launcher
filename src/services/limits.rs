//! What stops a mini-app that does NOT play nicely.
//!
//! The permission model answers "may this app do X". It says nothing about
//! "may it do X four thousand times a second", and a sandbox that contains a
//! hostile app but lets it wedge the launcher is only half a sandbox. An app
//! cannot escape its isolate — that is enforced elsewhere and is not in
//! question here — but until this module existed it could:
//!
//! - loop `files.pick` and stack native file dialogs on the user,
//! - loop `clipboard.read` and spawn a process per call,
//! - loop `url.open` and fill the screen with browser tabs,
//! - loop `location.get` and turn the launcher into a request amplifier,
//! - hammer another app's isolate through `ipc.send`.
//!
//! So every brokered request spends from a per-app token bucket priced by
//! what the service actually costs, the services that put OS UI on screen are
//! additionally one-at-a-time and foreground-only, and an app that keeps
//! slamming into the limit earns strikes. Enough strikes and the launcher
//! stops it and tells the user, which is the only honest end state: a program
//! that will not stop asking has to be made to stop.
