//! `agent-skills`: persistent dialect-guide injection on the octos side.
//!
//! `octos acp` assembles each session's system prompt from, among other
//! things, bootstrap files in `<session-cwd>/.octos/` — `AGENTS.md` is read on
//! every `session/new` and APPENDED to the base prompt, uncapped (see
//! `load_bootstrap_files` in octos-cli and its call in `ConfigAgentFactory::
//! build`). Since the launcher spawns one agent per generation with the
//! workspace as cwd, writing the guide there once makes every session carry it
//! — and per-turn prompts shrink from ~6KB of guide to one pointer line.
//!
//! Freshness is free: a new `session/new` happens every generation, and the
//! deploy below rewrites the file whenever the compiled-in guide changed.
//!
//! Note this mechanism is octos-specific (other ACP agents won't read it), so
//! the slim prompt is only used after a successful deploy — and a foreign
//! agent pointed at via `HOST_LAUNCHER_AGENT_CMD` that ignores the file still
//! works, just with the guide inlined per prompt as usual... unless it ALSO
//! runs with this workspace cwd and honors AGENTS.md, in which case it wins
//! too. The offline `fake_acp` ignores prompts entirely, so tests pass either
//! way.
