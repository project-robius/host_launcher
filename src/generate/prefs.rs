//! What to ask the agent for — and, crucially, *which* knobs even exist.
//!
//! There is no cross-provider standard for this: Claude Code takes model,
//! effort and a thinking budget through environment variables it reads itself;
//! octos takes a model as a CLI flag and exposes nothing else we can drive;
//! a foreign ACP agent (`HOST_LAUNCHER_AGENT_CMD`) is a black box. So the bar
//! doesn't show one fixed set of controls — it asks the ACTIVE backend what it
//! supports and renders that. A knob no one can deliver is worse than a
//! missing one: it looks like it works.
//!
//! Adding a provider's knob is a table entry in `Backend::knobs` plus a rule in
//! `env`/`args` for how it's delivered. Please don't add one without checking
//! the delivery mechanism actually exists — see DESIGN_DECISIONS #41.
