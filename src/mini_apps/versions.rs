//! Version history for modified mini-apps.
//!
//! Every time an app's script is rewritten (an AI modification, or restoring
//! an older version), the *previous* state is snapshotted first, so the user
//! can always get back to what they had. Snapshots live beside the app's code
//! in its own directory:
//!
//! ```text
//! apps/<id>/versions/20260724-153204.splash   the source as it was
//! apps/<id>/versions/20260724-153204.json     when, why, and its name/icon/tint
//! ```
//!
//! The stamp is local wall-clock time, so a version is identifiable straight
//! from the filename (the user asked for date/timestamped versions). The
//! `.splash` is written first and the `.json` last — listing keys off the
//! `.json`, so a crash mid-snapshot leaves an ignored orphan rather than a
//! version that claims to exist but has no code (same ordering rule as
//! `save_user_app`).
